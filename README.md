# Cashflow_project

Created using Ruby, Sinatra and PostgreSQL, the app allows a user to easily track their spending on a monthly basis.  

  - A budget is input by the user and they are able to add transactions as they spend, reducing the budget balance. 
  - To better analyse what users spend their budget on, each transaction has a category such as food or entertainment, 
    with the added functionality of calculating spending by category.
    
The potential users were identified as cash-strapped students, therefore, the app has a light hearted, 
fun user interface with a snapping picture of a crocodile indicating how close to the budget they are.
